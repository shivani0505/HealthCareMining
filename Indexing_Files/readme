Data extracted from the MetaMap tool is divided into different files based on websites of each post.

Use Script_Update_Info_In_csv.py file to append additional information about the post from the scraped data.
The scraped data is stored at the location : "/Users/shivanipriya/Documents/GitHub/HealthCareMining/ScraperFiles/stage1_scrapping.json".

Additionally, use Script_Convert_csv_json.py file to convert the csv file generated in the previous file to json format.
This file will be used in Apache Solr for indexing the post based on the total weight assigned to each post.
