Semantic Web Mining Project On Health Care Mining.
The main objective of this project is to develop a informative website that converts the unstructured data from user written **COVID-19** related posts that were scraped from various forums like ( [MedHelp.com](https://www.medhelp.org/forums/Coronavirus/show/2203), [Patient.info](https://patient.info/coronavirus-covid-19), [Mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/) ) into properly structured data and developing a parameter based search interface to provide the relevant posts, symptoms and treatments (if any) based on the user's search.
